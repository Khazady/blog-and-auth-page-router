excerpt: "Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations. Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more."

# Next.js Framework

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications. It is often used for building fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications.

## Features

- **Server-side rendering (SSR):** Next.js allows rendering React components on the server-side, providing faster page load times and better SEO performance.
- **Static site generation (SSG):** Next.js can pre-render pages at build time, resulting in static HTML files that can be served directly from a CDN, enhancing performance and reducing server load.
- **Automatic code splitting:** Next.js automatically splits JavaScript code into smaller chunks, allowing only the necessary code to be loaded for each page, improving load times.
- **Hot module replacement (HMR):** Next.js supports HMR, enabling developers to see changes in real-time without refreshing the browser during development.
- **API routes:** Next.js allows defining API routes within the same project, simplifying backend integration and making it easy to create serverless functions.
- **File-based routing:** Next.js uses a file-based routing system, where each page corresponds to a React component file, streamlining the development process.
- **TypeScript support:** Next.js has built-in support for TypeScript, enabling developers to write type-safe code and catch errors early in the development process.
- **CSS-in-JS support:** Next.js supports various CSS-in-JS solutions, such as styled-components and Emotion, for styling React components.
