excerpt: "Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

## What is NextJS?
NextJS is a **full-stack framework** for React.

- It's considered *full-stack* because it seamlessly blends backend (BE) and frontend (FE) code together. 
- It's classified as a **framework** because it boasts a plethora of built-in features, such as *routing*, and provides clear guidance on how to use them.

**Off-topic:** 
- React is a JavaScript framework (library) itself. 
- A *framework* is a type of library that has clear rules on how to write code.
