## JWT (JSON Web Token)
JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
It is often used for authentication and information exchange.

### Workflow!

1.  api/login > creates JWT
2.  save in localStorage < response with JWT 
3.  request with signed JWT (placed in header) > validate JWT

### SPA

## Session

FE <> DB

2.  save cookie < response (session id)

Requires storage
