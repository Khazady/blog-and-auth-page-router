## Rest(ful) API

A RESTful API uses standard HTTP methods—GET, POST, PUT and DELETE—to work with resources.

## CDN

A Content Delivery Network caches static assets on servers around the world, reducing latency for users.

## DNS

The Domain Name System converts human‑readable domain names into IP addresses.

## Security

### CORS
Cross‑Origin Resource Sharing controls which domains can access API resources.

### CSRF
Cross‑Site Request Forgery forces a logged‑in user to perform unwanted actions.

### XSS
Cross‑Site Scripting injects malicious scripts into trusted websites.

### HTTP(S)
HTTPS adds encryption on top of HTTP for secure communication.

### Man in the middle
An attacker intercepts traffic between two parties.

## Common questions

### After entering URL into the address bar

1. The browser resolves the domain via DNS and receives an IP address.
2. It downloads HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
3. The page renders and hydrates.
